ðŸŒŸ AI in Action: A Regional Conference for Builders
December 20â€“21, 2025 â€“ Kathmandu, Nepal
From building the web to building with AI â€” this December, the community behind Web Weekend Kathmandu brings you our next chapter: AI in Action.
A two-day experience designed for engineers, designers, product folks, and builders of all kinds who are using AI to create, ship, and scale products.
Whatâ€™s happening
Day 1 â€“ Conference (Dec 20):
A single-track conference with 8â€“9 talks from a mix of international and local speakers. Expect case studies, engineering tactics, and design perspectives on how AI is being used in the real world. Talks are fast-paced (~20 minutes each) with panel-style Q&A sessions to keep things interactive. An evening networking mixer wraps up the day.
Day 2 â€“ Community Hike (Dec 21):
Our signature tradition continues â€” a community hike to Nagi Gumba, Shivapuri. A light 3â€“4 hour trail where attendees, speakers, and organizers connect beyond the conference hall. Itâ€™s the part of the event people never forget.
Why Attend?
Because AI isnâ€™t just research papers â€” itâ€™s part of how we all work, design, and build. This conference is about AI in practice â€” real stories, lessons, and tactics from people building with AI right now.
Tickets
ðŸŽŸ Standard: NPR 3,500 â€“ 4,000
ðŸ”¥ Early bird: Limited discounted tickets available
ðŸŽ“ Student support: Case-by-case discounts

December 20â€“21, 2025 â€“ Kathmandu, Nepal
Weâ€™re looking for engineers, designers, and builders who are creating with AI â€” whether youâ€™re building with AI (using AI in your products or workflows) or building for AI (designing applications, interfaces, or systems that enable others to use AI).
At AI in Action: A Regional Conference for Builders, weâ€™re not talking about research papers or theory. Weâ€™re showcasing practical applications of AI: how teams are building with and for AI, what worked, what didnâ€™t, and what lessons others can take away.
What weâ€™re looking for
ðŸŽ¤ Talks (~20 mins each) that bring real insights from building with/for AI. Possible angles:
Case studies from your product or company
Engineering tactics or approaches to building AI-powered applications
Designing AI interfaces and user experiences
Building infrastructure or tools that make AI usable in practice
AI in operations, growth, or product management
Stories of scaling, failing, and iterating with AI
Talks will be followed by panel-style Q&A to spark interactive discussions.
Who should apply?
Engineers and designers building with or for AI
Founders and product leads shipping AI-powered tools
Builders experimenting with LLMs, agents, or applied AI in the workplace
Why speak?
Share your story with 300+ professionals from across Nepal and South Asia
Connect with fellow builders and industry leaders
Be part of a unique event â€” from the conference floor to the community hike
